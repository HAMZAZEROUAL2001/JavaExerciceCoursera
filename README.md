# JavaExerciceCoursera

This is a great Java exercise on Coursera  https.
//www.coursera.org/learn/programmation-orientee-objet-java/lecture/6gOvz/introduction.
Here is the proposed solution
The purpose of these exercises is to apply the principles of object-oriented programming 

Abstraction: This principle focuses on the ability to identify the common characteristics of similar objects and group them into an abstract class. Objects can be created from this abstract class and can inherit its characteristics.

Encapsulation: This principle focuses on protecting data by hiding it inside the object and providing controlled ways to access this data. This ensures the integrity of the data and protects them from unwanted changes.

Inheritance: This principle allows you to define a new class based on an existing class. The new class can inherit all the characteristics of the base class and can also add new characteristics.

Polymorphism: This principle focuses on the ability of an object to take several forms. This can be achieved by using method overloads and overdefinitions, which allows an object to respond to method calls in different ways depending on the situation.
